## API

[API](API.md)

The full [API](API.md) includes all exports from this library. While the source code
is light, the list of exported function is long. To make it easier to navigate,
here are the same exports broken into categories. Some functions will be found
in multiple categories. We just wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to
quickly find what you're looking for.

* [Async](ASYNC.md)
* [Comparison](COMPARISON.md)
* [Compilable](COMPILABLE.md)
* [Composition](COMPOSITION.md)

* [Error](ERROR.md)
* [Foundational](FOUNDATIONAL.md)
* [Spreadable](SPREADABLE.md)
