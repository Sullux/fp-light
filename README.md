# fp-light

This is a functional programming library with a focus on point-free coding style
and abstracting the complexity of asynchronous programming. This library has no
dependencies, so adding it to your project does not introduce a lot of bloat.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -P @sullux/fp-light
# or
yarn add @sullux/fp-light
```

## Basic Usage

Coming soon!

These docs are in the process of being built. We will be using the common
pattern of even numbered releases for LTS, so we are treating this 1.0 release
as a beta. While most of this library is relatively stable, some things might
change before we get to our first LTS candidate.

## Full Function Reference

Coming soon! For now, see the [FP Light Demo](https://github.com/Sullux/fp-light-demo) project for usage examples.

## Development

Coming soon!
