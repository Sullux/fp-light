# Guide To Globalizing The FP Language Elements

This is an early draft of this guide. More coming soon.

This guide looks a bit different depending on whether you are using Common JS Modules (CJS, using the `require` statement and `module.exports`) or ES Modules (MJS, using the `import` and `export` statements). We will refrain from commenting on the _State Of Javascriptâ„¢_ except to say that this discrepancy sucks and there is no easy solution to make the two patterns work together seemlessly.

Our workaround for the moment is to let you choose your own adventure:

I will choose [CJS (with require and module.exports)](https://github.com/Sullux/fp-light/blob/master/GLOBALIZING-GUIDE-CJS.md).

I will choose [MJS (with import and export)](https://github.com/Sullux/fp-light/blob/master/GLOBALIZING-GUIDE-MJS.md).
